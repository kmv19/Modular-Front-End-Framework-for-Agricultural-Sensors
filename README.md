# Modular-Front-End-Framework-for-Agricultural-Sensors
This project focuses on the development of a modular front-end framework for agricultural sensors, focusing on the integration of a capacitive-based leaf wetness sensor into a standalone system. 

Accurate monitoring of leaf wetness is essential for effective crop management and this system aims to provide reliable and autonomous data collection. The framework incorporates a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, a solar-powered battery management system (including a solar panel, solar charge controller and Li-ion batteries).

An OLED display, an SD card and an RTC module contribute in acquiring, processing, displaying and storing sensor data. The system addresses key challenges such as ensuring continuous power supply, handling real-time data efficiently and operating independently in diverse environmental conditions. Testing confirms the moduleâ€™s ability to function autonomously while providing accurate and reliable data, thus supporting improved decision-making in agricultural management.
